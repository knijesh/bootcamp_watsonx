We'll then append these passages as context to the prompt that will be passed to the LLM in watsonx.ai for generation.\n","\n","## Introduction\n","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of pre-trained large language models (LLM) and information retrieval systems to generate responses based on a given context. In this notebook, we will be using a Vector Database and watsonx.ai foundation models to implement a RAG use-case.\n","\n","A vector database (or store), when applied to text data, is a specialized database that efficiently stores embeddings, representing pieces of text, for efficient queries. It enables quick similarity searches, allowing you to pinpoint texts that are 'similar' based on their vectorized representations. For our purposes, we will use Chroma, an open-source embedding database.\n","\n","Instead of using Watson Discovery to pass back the relevant passages, we are using a vector database called Chroma. Chroma is mainly used to parse through the PDFs, store the content, and then query from that collection. The code in the notebook below demonstrates the implementation of this approach.\n","\n","## Pre-requisites\n","This lab should take about 45 minutes.\n","\n","Before we begin lets start off by ensuring we have completed some pre-requisites; ensure you gave the following\n","\n","IBM Cloud API key : Jji78y2ydCGE0k8YrvIRdIqIP02zAaTbfl6H_O6FhbaY (for sean)\n","Project ID associated with your watsonx instance: 7851b112-765c-45df-91f3-fe9ce1ecb5e3 (for IBM_PH)\n","You can use the following support links if you need any help with the pre-requisites above\n","\n","Creating IBM Cloud API Key\n","Finding watsonx Project ID\n","Setting up\n","Importing Required Libraries\n","Before we get started looking at some code, we will need to install some dependencies for our notebook; the following notebook cell will do just that."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}},"source":["#### Disclaimers\n","\n","- Use only Projects and Spaces that are available in watsonx context.\n","\n","## Notebook content\n","This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of Retrieval Augumented Generation in watsonx.ai.
